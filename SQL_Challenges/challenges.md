I've examined your Fitness & Nutrition Tracking System schema, and I'll create a series of SQL practice challenges tailored to your database. These challenges will progressively increase in difficulty and cover all the SQL concepts you mentioned.

# SQL Practice Challenges for Fitness & Nutrition Tracking System

## Beginner Challenges

### Challenge 1: Basic SELECT queries
Write a query to retrieve all users with their name, email, weight, and height.

### Challenge 2: WHERE clause filtering
Find all food items that belong to a specific category (e.g., category_id = 1).

### Challenge 3: ORDER BY clause
List all exercises ordered by difficulty level (beginner first, then intermediate, then advanced).

### Challenge 4: LIMIT clause
Retrieve the 5 most recently created nutrition plans.

### Challenge 5: Simple aggregation
Count how many different food items are in the database.

## Intermediate Challenges

### Challenge 6: Inner JOIN operation
List all meals along with their food items. Include meal name, food item name, and quantity.

### Challenge 7: Multiple JOINs
Find all users who have created exercise plans, showing the user name, plan name, and plan level.

### Challenge 8: GROUP BY with aggregation
Calculate the total number of food items in each food category, and order the results by count in descending order.

### Challenge 9: HAVING clause
Find all meals that have more than 3 food items.

### Challenge 10: Subquery in WHERE clause
List all users who have created at least one exercise with "advanced" difficulty.

## Advanced Challenges

### Challenge 11: Complex JOINs with multiple tables
List all nutrition plans along with the total number of unique food items across all days and meals in each plan.

### Challenge 12: LEFT JOIN
Find all users and their exercise plans, including users who don't have any exercise plans.

### Challenge 13: CROSS JOIN
Create a report that shows all possible combinations of food categories and exercise difficulty levels.

### Challenge 14: SELF JOIN
Find pairs of users who have the same weight (but are different users).

### Challenge 15: RIGHT JOIN
List all exercises and the exercise plan items they appear in, including exercises that aren't used in any plan.

### Challenge 16: UNION operation
Create a combined list of all food item names and exercise names, indicating which type each name belongs to.

### Challenge 17: INTERSECT operation
Find all users who have both a nutrition plan and an exercise plan.

### Challenge 18: Common Table Expressions (CTE)
Use a CTE to find the users who have created the most food items, then list those users and the food items they've created.

### Challenge 19: Window functions
Rank meals based on the number of food items they contain, and display the rank alongside the meal details.

### Challenge 20: Complex subqueries and joins
Find the users who have the most complete fitness profiles by creating a query that scores users based on whether they have: exercise plans, nutrition plans, weight/height data, and biographical information.

Would you like me to provide detailed solutions for any of these challenges, or would you prefer to tackle them yourself first? I can also create additional challenges focusing on specific SQL concepts if you're interested.

# SQL Practice Challenges for Fitness & Nutrition Tracking System

## Beginner Challenges

### B1: Basic Selects
Find all users who are currently active in the system.

### B2: Simple Joins
List all food items along with their category names.

### B3: Filtering with Multiple Conditions
Find all exercises that are for beginners and target the core muscle group.

### B4: Simple Aggregation
Count how many food items exist in each food category.

### B5: Basic Data Modification
Update the difficulty level of all exercises created by user ID 4 to 'intermediate'.

## Intermediate Challenges

### I1: Complex Joins
Find all users who have created both exercise plans and nutrition plans, and show the count of each.

### I2: Subqueries
Find all meals that contain food items with a protein content greater than 20g per 100g.

### I3: Advanced Aggregations
Calculate the average calorie content of each meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack).

### I4: Date Functions
Find all exercise plans created in the last 30 days and their creator names.

### I5: Window Functions
Rank food items within each category based on their protein content (highest to lowest).

### I6: JSON/JSONB Data
Extract and analyze the micronutrient content from food items, specifically finding items rich in vitamin C.

## Advanced Challenges

### A1: Complex Query Optimization
Create an efficient query to find users who have both created high-protein meals (avg protein > 25g) and have completed advanced exercise plans.

### A2: Recursive Queries
Implement a query that shows the complete nutritional breakdown of a 7-day nutrition plan (sum all nutrients from all food items across all days).

### A3: Advanced Analytics
Calculate the calorie deficit/surplus for each user based on their recorded exercise plans and nutrition plans over a month period.

### A4: Dynamic Pivoting
Create a dynamic pivot table showing exercise frequency by muscle group and difficulty level.

### A5: Custom Functions
Write a SQL function that recommends food items to complement a user's existing meal based on nutritional gaps.

### A6: Transaction Management
Create a transaction that safely transfers all exercise plans from one user to another when merging accounts.

### A7: Temporal Data Analysis
Analyze user weight changes over time in relation to their adherence to nutrition and exercise plans.
